It’s very convenient to separate your areas of activity using accounts in Chrome. You don’t lose your bookmarks, you don’t have to log out anywhere, necessary extensions are already installed.

You can [read more](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/custom-chrome-browser-profiles/) how to organize your Chrome space better.

But if you are a Power User and constantly switch between profiles, there is one problem. When you open a link not from Chrome (Mail app, Skype, Word, etc.), the system opens the last used Chrome account.

For these purposes, I created [Account Surfer](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PHVP9RJR7R7).

When you open a link, Account Surfer asks in which profile to open it and you can save the domain always opened there:

Accounts can now be opened even faster using hotkeys:
